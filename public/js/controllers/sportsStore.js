//The main role of the top-level controller in the SportsStore application is to define the data that will be used in
//the different views that the application will display.

//Omitting the second argument tells AngularJS that you want to locate a module that has already been defined.
//In this situation, AngularJS will report an error if the module specified doesnï¿½t exist

//angular.module method return a Module object that can be used to define application functionality
